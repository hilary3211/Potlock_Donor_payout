#  POTLOCK Donor Payout  Smart Contract

Built on the NEAR blockchain, facilitates a donation and airdrop system for campaigns. It maintains detailed records of user donations and airdrop distributions, enabling donors to receive token or NFT rewards post-donation. The contract integrates with a Potlock NFT contract ```potlock-nfts.testnet``` to mint NFTs as rewards for eligible donors.


## Features
- Donation Tracking: Records user donations in yoctoNEAR, associating them with a donorâ€™s account ID and campaign.

- Airdrop Management: Logs airdrop distributions (tokens or NFTs) with details like recipient, amount, timestamp, campaign ID, and reward type.

- NFT Rewards: Allows donors to claim NFT rewards via a cross-contract call to a Genadrop NFT contract, updating airdrop records with minted NFT details.

- Campaign Support: Tracks donations and airdrops per campaign, with pagination for retrieving airdrop records.

- Storage Management: Requires deposits to cover storage costs for state updates, ensuring scalability on NEAR.



## Technologies Used
- Rust: The programming language used to write the smart contract.

- NEAR SDK: For interacting with the NEAR blockchain.

- NEAR Testnet: The contract is deployed on the NEAR Testnet for testing.
